When visiting a new place, finding the best or cheapest restaurant is essential, and Zomato helps with ratings and reviews across India. In this project, we analyze Zomato’s dataset for Bengaluru, containing 51,717 rows and 17 features, to identify factors that influence restaurant ratings. Our main focus is to find the cheapest restaurant and explore relationships like the most expensive, best locations, and how location affects rankings.

We start with data analysis using Python—handling missing values, dropping duplicates, and transforming data. Our target variable is "Rates," and we will explore the correlation between this and other features through visualizations like bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps. This analysis will provide insights into how different factors such as location, cuisine, and cost impact restaurant ratings, offering a deeper understanding of Bengaluru’s dynamic food scene.# Zomato-Bengaluru-Data-Analysis
